# Build a Game-Playing Agent

For the AIND Project 2: Build a Game-Playing Agent, we were introduced to the game Isolation and the concepts of Minimax tree search and Alpha-Beta pruning.

In addition we were asked to develop our own heuristics to attempt to beat the supplied heuristics. This was more difficult than expected and illustrated the tradeoff between a heuristic complexity and speed when used for tree search.

## Game UI â™ž
I made some changes to the Game UI to allow board numbering, player colors and visual display of possible moves. Thanks to [@ltfschoen](https://
