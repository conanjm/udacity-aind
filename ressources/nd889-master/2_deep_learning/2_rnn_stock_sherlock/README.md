# Project 2: RNN Apple Stock & Sherlock Holmes

For this project we built and trainined RNNs in Keras. First to approximate a recursive function that defines Apple's stock based on the training data and then used to predict the test data.

In the second part, an RNN was trained on large sections of the story Sherlock Holmes and then used to output a predicted sentance after a given input.

Instructions:
```
$ jupyter notebook RNN_project.ipynb
```
