# Project 4: Facial Keypoint Detection Pipeline

For this project we created a Facial Keypoint Detection Pipeline using a combination of OpenCV to detect facial bounding boxes and a CNN trained on Facial Keypoints using the this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data) from Kaggle.

The final pipeline was able to take image files or image frames from OpenCV webcam input and draw the facial keypoints as well as overlay funny images.
