## Term 2: Deep Learning and Applications

* [Sentiment Analysis with Numpy](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/sentiment-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Intro to TensorFlow](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-tensorflow): Starting building neural networks with Tensorflow.
* [Weight Intialization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/weight-initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and denoising, using feed-forward and convolution networks in TensorFlow.
* [Transfer Learning (ConvNet)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own large networkd on huge datasets, but use pretrained networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to classify images of flowers without training a network on the images themselves.
* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Character-wise RNN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-rnns): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text.
* [Embeddings (Word2Vec)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/embeddings): Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.
* [Sentiment Analysis RNN](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/sentiment-rnn): Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if a text sample is positive or negative.
* [Tensorboard](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tensorboard): Use TensorBoard to visualize the network graph, as well as how parameters change through training.
* [Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/reinforcement): Implement a deep Q-learning network to play a simple game from OpenAI Gym.
* [Sequence to sequence](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/seq2seq): Implement a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network.
* [Batch normalization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/batch-norm): Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.

* [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/dcgan-svhn): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
* [Intro to TFLearn](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-tflearn): A couple introductions to a high-level library for building neural networks.
* [Image classification](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification): Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
* [Text Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [Machine Translation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/language-translation): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/face_generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
* CNN: Dog Breed Image Classifier
* RNN: Apple Stock & Sherlock Homes Text Generation
